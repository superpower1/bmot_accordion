1. If "'classNames' is not defined" shows up, run "npm install --save classnames" to install and include classNames in Accodion.js using "import classNames from 'classnames';"

2. Because the aws server api is broken, I have commented out data fetching code in Accordion.js which you can later uncomment

3. I used some styles and effects from bootstrap so make sure to put this link in html
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/latest/css/bootstrap.min.css"> 
and run "npm install --save react-bootstrap" to install.
